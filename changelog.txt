03.05.2023  Xiris   - A change to how debuffs works and minor things 
        MAJOR
        xiris_debuffing
            The solution I had for triggers in the ini of each toon didnt work due to how strings are parsed.
            no the trigger is a key into a list of debuffs that are enumerated in the debuffing inc file.
            eg: DEBUFF_3_Trigger=CRIPPLE now will triggerr the check in Sub chkDebuffTrigger(string _key) 
            if it returns true, then fires that debuff. This list can be updated if necessary.
            Debuff KEYS are: 
            [PUTRID_DECAY, MALOS, TURGURS, BALANCE_DISCORD, TASHAN, DESOLATE_DEEDS, CRIPPLE, 
            DRUID_SUN, DRUID_GLACIER, DRUID_VINES, HARMONY, REVERSE_DS] 


02.07.2023  Xiris   - Several large changes requiring find/replace.
        MAJOR
        bot_pull        
            Added argument to not pull per se. Will kill mob where it finds it
            will still return to a camp when done killing. Useful for epic item farms

        xiris_debuffing 
            Added LoS check before attempting to cast, fixed a variable name

        xiris_events_raid_oow_anguish
            Fixed hanvarCaster check (added timer so they don't constantly check debuffs)
            Fixed AMV events that had bad copy pasted code from Hanvar events
            Fixed chkGroupMarkedForDeath to have clr/shm to have their group members run for
            cure and not warp
            Fixed chkMarkedForDeathCureDist having wrong TLO for Target

        xiris_healing   
            **!!!Note: Global find and replace !!!***
            Changed heal points and other vars to be int_point_[group,self,tank]_[normal,frantic,HoT]
            for consistency. See diff for details. 
            Many files referenced these vars including CHARACTER INI FILES!
            Optimized healGRP to use MQ2WorstHurt efficiently
            Changed setHealingSpell to be used consistently and globally

            One additional cleric to autoCureMTon
